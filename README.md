# Parallax
Parallax is a Kubernetes operator that enables dynamic, list-driven parallel execution of Jobs and CronJobs.  It abstracts away the complexity of sharding workloads over a list of inputs — whether from APIs, databases, or static lists — and manages concurrency, indexing, and job orchestration transparently.
